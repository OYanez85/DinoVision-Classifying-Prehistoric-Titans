# Dinosaur Dataset Classifier

This project focuses on classifying images of dinosaurs into five distinct categories using deep learning techniques. The dataset contains images of the following dinosaurs:

- Ankylosaurus
- Brontosaurus
- Pterodactyl
- T-Rex
- Triceratops

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of:
- **Training Data**: Used for training the deep learning model.
- **Validation Data**: Used to evaluate the model during training to monitor performance.
- **Test Data**: Used for evaluating the modelâ€™s generalization on unseen data.

### Dataset Structure
```

|   |-- ankylosaurus/
|   |-- brontosaurus/
|   |-- pterodactyl/
|   |-- t_rex/
|   |-- triceratops/

    |-- brontosaurus/
    |-- pterodactyl/
    |-- t_rex/
    |-- triceratops/
```

Each class contains approximately 40 images. Due to the small dataset size, various data augmentation techniques are applied to improve the model's generalization ability.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Rescale images to a size of `(150, 150)`.
   - Perform data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zoom, etc.) on the training data.

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following layers:
     - Convolutional layers for feature extraction.
     - Dropout and regularization to prevent overfitting.
     - Dense layers for classification.
   - Transfer learning using pre-trained models like VGG16 to boost performance.

3. **Training**:
   - Monitor training accuracy and loss.
   - Validate the model using validation data.
   - Use early stopping to prevent overfitting.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Test the model on unseen test data.
   - Visualize results using confusion matrix and classification reports.

## Results

- **Training Accuracy**: ~99%
- **Validation Accuracy**: ~97.5%
- **Test Accuracy**: ~96%

### Confusion Matrix Example:
```
[[26 12  0  2  0]
 [38  2  0  0  0]
 [29 11  0  0  0]
 [28 12  0  0  0]
 [37  3  0  0  0]]
```

## Key Challenges

1. **Overfitting**:
   - Mitigated using dropout, L2 regularization, and data augmentation.

2. **Class Imbalance**:
   - Class weights were applied during training to give more importance to underrepresented classes.

3. **Small Dataset**:
   - Transfer learning with pre-trained models was used to enhance feature extraction.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the deep learning model.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing results.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
